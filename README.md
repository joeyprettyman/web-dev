# Web Development
I tried to tackle the task of sorting and organizing all of my previous web development projects. Believe-it-or-not, what you're looking at, is the result of that task. I know it's hard to believe, given it's current state, but it was even worse before. I'll eventually sort this repo and have better project descriptions, but for now, I've tried to name them with as much specificity as possible.
