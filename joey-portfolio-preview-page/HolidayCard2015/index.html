			<p>
				Global events in 2015 have shown how the predictable, impartial rule of law enables people to flourish, and equally how its absence is marked by oppression and corruption. At FaegreBD, we are proud to help provide fair and impartial justice for all populations. Our 2015 giving initiative supports two organizations promoting the rule of law. We hope you will take a moment to learn more about these organizations and their important work.

			<h2 class="headings" id="second"> Legal Services Corporation </h2>
			<p>
				Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is an independent nonprofit established by the United States Congress over 40 years ago to provide financial support for civil legal aid to low-income Americans. LSC promotes equal access to justice by providing funding to 134 independent, nonprofit legal aid programs in every state, the District of Columbia and U.S. Territories. LSC grantees serve thousands of low-income individuals, children, families, seniors and veterans in 813 offices in every congressional district.<br><br>
				
				LSC grantees help constituents who live in households with annual incomes at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. LSC-funded legal aid ensures that eligible persons will not have to navigate the legal system alone. Eligible clients include the working poor, veterans and military families, homeowners and renters, families with children, farmers, the disabled, and the elderly. LSC-provided legal aid lawyers and associated pro bono volunteers address basic needs including housing, education, family stability, safety and economic security. 	<br><br>

			<h2 class="headings" id="third"> The Advocates for Human Rights </h2>
			<p>
				The Advocates for Human Rights is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to implementing international human rights standards to promote civil society and reinforce the rule of law on a local, national and global scale.  <br><br>

				The Advocates focuses on refugees and immigrants, women, ethnic and religious minorities, members of the world’s LGTBI communities, children and other marginalized peoples. Using a pro bono volunteer model that leverages The Advocates’ dollars by more than eight times, the organization investigates and exposes human rights violations, represents immigrants and refugees seeking asylum, partners with and assists groups that protect human rights, and engages in advocacy for legal reform and sound policy both globally and in the United States. <br><br>

				The Advocates has monitored human rights conditions and produced over 75 reports documenting human rights practices in more than 25 countries. Of special note is the organization’s work on transitional justice, the process by which post-conflict countries that have experienced a breakdown of the rule of law move forward to build institutions to promote the rule of law and establish safe and just societies.<br><br>
